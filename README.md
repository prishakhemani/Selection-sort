# Selection-sort
# Theory
Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that selects the smallest element from an unsorted list and sets it at the beginning of the unsorted list in each iteration. It sorts an array by repeatedly choosing the smallest member from the unsorted segment and placing it at the beginning (in ascending order).
